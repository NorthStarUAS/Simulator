# Panda3d_Kivy - CLO - 9 April, 2025

panda3d_kivy contained here is a copy of the original work by Cheaterman.  The original can be found here:

    <https://github.com/Cheaterman/panda3d-kivy>

The only changes here are to the import paths to help it integrate correctly inside the NST package (versus expecting to be installed as a top level/standalone package.)

Requires panda3d and kivy to be installed system or user-wide.

This package enables kivy uix elements to run on top of a panda3d window ...
enabling a more sophisticated user interface experience than can be accomplished
with native panda3d gui elements.
