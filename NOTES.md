# Random Notes and Thoughts

Caution: this is anevolving project.  Much of the information could be outdated.
The notes here reflect my thinking and best understanding as I go.  With this
project specifically, I keep learning (or thinking of) new things and
backtracking and redoing things (breaking other things in the process).  If you
see any comments here that are wildly wrong or misleading, please let me know so
I can fix and improve the information.  Don't feel bad about calling me out on
my mistakes. It's all good and helps me learn new things and make this system
better.

## Mar 25, 2024: Deterministic vs. Non-deterministic solutions

Lacking the energy to look up the official mathematical definition, here is what
I mean:

* Deterministic: the previous state(s) of the "y" are not included in the
  solution.  The estimate could be computed (via matrix math) in one step.

* Non-deterministic: the previous state(s) of "y" roll forward into the next
  estimate.  Sorta: the solution is a mix of some portion of the current state
  combined with other terms.

Some values can be computed from other terms each iteration (deterministic) but
some values carry momentum and rolling in the previous state(s) enables a more
accurate solution ... if it converges ... and convergence is hard to prove
beyond throwing some data sets at the formula to see what happens.

Ok for non-deterministic solutions I'd like to carry more than just the previous
state.  I'd like to carry n-1, n-2, ... and like to formalize that a bit in the
code so I can experiment with different amounts of history on different states.

What I need:

* A nomenclature: p = current roll rate, p_1 = previous roll rate, p_2 = the
  roll rate before that, etc.
  * I will only support digits 1-9 (0 is the current term) beyond that would be
    silly and this restriction makes the coding a bit simpler. (I could get
    fancy with regex, but ugh)
  * "_" (underscore) will be allowed in other places in the term name, but if it
    is "_n" at the end of the term it has special meaning.  alpha_dot_term3 is ok
    and just a top level current term.
* A function to find these _n terms (dst) and their source term and a mapping of
  src_idx -> dst_idx for propagating these back in time.
* Every term (even the _n terms) need their own row in the X and Y matrices.
  This data needs to be built up correctly when the data is loaded.  This allows
  us to fit the A matrix with 'perfect' original data.
* When simulating:
  * we need to initial the estimated target to zero and all of it's cascading
    history
  * we need to roll the simulated estimates down cascading to each following
    term, so we can't depend on the pre-cooked data.
* system will propagate bottom up, so don't put ax_2 before ax_1 in the list or
  it will screw everything up!  It's not that smart .....
* self_reference=False means we can't use propagated states of the self state.

## Dec 30, 2021: Nature of fitting to noisy / imperfect data

We have a bunch of buckets to fit the data into.  When there is noise
or bias or imperfections or external forces we can't fully measure
and account for (like wind) then there will be errors in the fit.  The
system blindly performs a best fit and the result is that all this
unaccounted for/unknown error is divided up into the different
available bins to minimize errors.

This can lead to incorrect relationships (i.e. if the elevator is
always pushing back against an altitude disturbance, we might find
this negative correlation in our fit ... we see increasing elevator
correlates with altitude loss.)

Generally when fit errors occur or inverse relationships are
'discovered' the system will boost some other parameter to
match/balance/cover the error.

The end result is the system does behave correctly and as expected
across the fit region, but extrapolating outside of the region
(especially when some independent parameters are scaled by qbar
(vel^2) can lead to some wild inaccuracies and nonphysical behavior,
possibly math divergence.  This is an expected downside of the method
used here.  We can possibly limit the damage by forcing the parameters
to stay within some std deviation range of the mean, but then when we
hit the edges of our envelope, other weird/non-phsyical/non-continuous
behavior could be observed.

Again, this is one of the major downsides to simply fitting flight
data (versus a more traditional approach of teasing out all the
individual aero coefficients and using those as inputs to a full
simulator model.)

## Dec 29, 2021: Selecting Parameters

This is a huge open issue with all kinds of implications and
interrelated effects.  This is just my current thinking on the matter.

* We need to select parameters that we can directly measure or
estimate with a reasonable expectation of mostly Gaussian error
characteristics.

* On the output side, I want to drive a simulation capable of
real-time or batch runs.  I need to select parameters that are
sufficient for updating the sim state, specifically I need to update
orientation and velocity (and then the updated velocity can be used to
update position.)

* I want plausible, physical, airplanie behavior from the simulation!

**Example 1:**

I can use a combination of EKF velocity in the NED coordinate frame +
a running wind vector estimate to estimate X, Y, Z velocity in the
aircraft body frame.  I can add the XYZ body velocities to the state
vector and predict their next values.  In the simulation, I can take
the next predicted XYZ velocities, rotate them back into the NED
coordinate frame and update the position.

However, there is nothing in the system that imposes any constraints
or correlations between the X, Y, and Z velocities, so potentially you
could find the aircraft sliding sideways with a massive Y velocity, or
backwards with a negative X velocity, and the prediction system will
happily carry on.

Instead, I have switched to modeling total velocity (airspeed), alpha
(angle of attack), and beta (side-slip).  These are still 3 values.  I
can convert back and forth between this form and body XYZ velocities.
However, using airspeed, alpha, and beta as input parameters
additionally imposes some natural constraints on the physical
relationship between the X, Y, and Z body frame velocities.

**Example 2:**

This is crude, believe me, I understand that.  The four major forces
influencing an aircraft are Lift vs. Gravity and Thrust vs. Drag.

Gravity: All our flight controllers estimate (and log) roll, pitch,
and yaw in flight.  We know the gravity vector is constant in the NED
frame of reference so we can use this information to rotate the
gravity vector into the aircraft body frame.  Now we know the amount
of gravity force in all 3 axes: X, Y, and Z.

Body Frame Accelerations: We are able to measure body accelerations on
our IMU, but unfortunately these are fairly biased, even on a
calibrated system, and they include gravity.)  So instead we can
approximate the body accelerations (without gravity) by:

    body_accels = (body_velocity - last_body_velocity) / dt

Lift: Now we can estimate lift (note that negative body acceleration
is "up" due to the coordinate system used, and measured gravity at
zero ned acceleration is -9.81.)

    lift = -body_accel_Z - body_gravity_Z

Side note: in the classic aerospace sense we need coefficient of lift
(Cl) which is dependent on alpha along with qbar (air density *
velocity^2 * 0.5) and wing area to compute lift.  In our case we can
compute lifting force directly with our mass and air density
normalized to a value of 1 to keep things simple.  This means we are
unable to vary mass, cg, air density, etc. in the simulation and the
aircraft will always fly as it was configured and as the air density
(r) existed on the day the test flight was performed.

Thrust: If this already wasn't pretty crude, now comes the real hack.
We don't have a direct way to measure thrust in our small UAVs and we
don't have a detailed motor/prop model we can extract directly from
the flight data, but we do know the throttle command.  As a very crude
estimate of thrust (normalized to a range of [0, 1] I do this:

    thrust = sqrt(throttle_command)

Some systems log voltagea and amps which can be used to compute watts
which is a direct measure of the power put into the propulsion system.
It still doesn't account for prop model, but it would fit better than
throttle command anbd would account for voltage drop over the course
of the flight.  For now I'm dealing with some flight logs that don't
include this data so I'm not using that additional information.

Drag: Now with an estimate of thrust we can estimate drag.  Note that
drag must balance both gravity and thrust in the aircraft X axis:

    drag = body_accel_X + body_gravity_X - thrust

This is a crude approximation.  It depends on mass and wing area
canceling each other out.  Units are nonstandard.  This is ok because
the coefficients in the state transition matrix are fit to produce the
correct parameter estimates in the next state.  (Future work might
include teasing out mass and geometry values and including those
correctly into the math, but for now leaving these out simplifies the
system tremendously.)
