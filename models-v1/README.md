# Model v1 notes

These are some UAV models I was experiementing with.  Don't expect them to do
anything useful in the new system until they are updated with the new version of
build_full_model.  However, these don't have alpha/beta sensors so the model
builder will need to be expanded to better estimate those.

* Bob Ross is a "happy mistakes" student design from the U of MN flown with a pixhawk.
* Idun2 is a UMN UAV Lab survey drone (XUAV Talon) with a Goldy (in-house) autopilot.
* Skywalker is my personal UAV test bed with running the whole North Star UAS
